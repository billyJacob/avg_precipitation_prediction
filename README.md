# avg_precipitation_prediction
So in this project we have chosen the US weather forecast dataset which has the historical data of, mean temperature , maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average_min_temp, average_max_temp, record_min_temp, record_max_temp, record_min_temp_year, record_max_temp_year, actual_precipitation, average_precipitation and record_precipitation of the New York City. Average precipitation is considered as the dependent variable here. This model can be used for the prediction of rain on a certain day.
